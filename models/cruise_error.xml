Hybrid clocks:
- Usually represent some continuous (dynamical) cost over the system state space.
- Can be used in rate (derivative) expressions.
- Cannot be used in constraints (guards and invariants).
- Are abstracted away and have no effect in symbolic analysis (Symbolic Simulator, queries like A[], E&lt;&gt;, TIGA safety synthesis), we can do this, because they do not influence the logic of the model.
- Are used in concrete simulations (Concrete Simulator, SMC queries like simulate, Pr, minE, maxE, E[...](max:)).
